These sub-graphs for [TheGraph](https://thegraph.com/en/) 
have been developed as part of
the [*Prenez Place !*](https://github.com/Prenez-Place/Face-B-Blockchain-module)
project.

Their role index and facilitate the
exploration of the information thus stored
on the blockchain.

🚧 This is work in progress, and currently mainly allows to share a dynamic store of keywords
relying only on decentralized and open networks.
